# Detecting Tissue Damage in Lungs – Alpha Tool
Project in Computer Science - EDAN70

This is the alpha release of a tool for detecting lung tissue damage. The tool is developed to be used in Covid-19 treatment development. 


## Setup
1. Download the [test data](https://github.com/augustlidfeldt) containing histology images from lungs tissue.

2. Download the [pretrained model](https://github.com/augustlidfeldt), the [model weights](https://github.com/augustlidfeldt) and the [labels](https://github.com/augustlidfeldt).

3. Open the [Alpha Tool](https://github.com/augustlidfeldt) in Google Colab and upload the test data folder, pretrained model, weights and labels in the side bar menu, placing them in the same directory in the folder /contents/, see image below.

4. Run code and see the results in the classification report output in the console.

5. For testing prediction on a specfic image point out model path in the second cell and run cell.
